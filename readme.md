## What is Power Automate?
Power Automate is an online workflow service that automates actions across the most common apps and services. For example, you can create a flow that posts a message on a Microsoft Teams channel whenever an issue is created in Jira or your favorite planning tool. These types of integrations can help the various tools you use everyday work better together.

When you sign up, you can connect to hundreds of services, and can manage data either in the cloud or in on-premises sources like SharePoint and Microsoft SQL Server. The list of applications you can use with Power Automate grows constantly.

## What can you do with Power Automate?

## Important concepts in Power Automate
Keep these concepts in mind when building flows:

Every flow has two main parts: a trigger, and one or more actions.
You can think of the trigger as the starting action for the flow. The trigger can be something like a new email arriving in your inbox or a new item being added to a list in Microsoft Lists.
Actions are what you want to happen when a trigger is invoked. For example, the new email trigger will start the action of creating a new file on OneDrive for Business. Other examples of actions include sending an email, posting a tweet, and starting an approval.
